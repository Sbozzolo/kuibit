Overview
========

``kuibit`` is a set of `openly developed <https://github.com/Sbozzolo/kuibit>`_.
tools to post-process simulations performed with the `Einstein Toolkit
<https://einsteintoolkit.org/>`_.

The goal of this package is to enable you to pursue your scientific goals
without having to worry about computational details (e.g., handling simulation
restarts, reading HDF5 files, ...). ``kuibit`` represent simulation data in
a high-level and intuitive way, and provides some commonly used routines in
numerical-relativity (e.g., computing the strain of gravitational waves).
A video introduction about ``kuibit`` can be found on
`YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-F2xh-m31A>`_ (a
`tutorial <https://youtu.be/14YOQ6SqTUU>`_ is also available)
The YouTube series
`Using kuibit <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIVVtc6RlFxpi3BiF6KTWd3z4TTQ5hY06>`_
contains video tutorials on ``kuibit``.

The :doc:`testimonials page <testimonials>` collects short user's reviews about
``kuibit``.

Summary of Features
-------------------

For a full list of available features, see the :doc:`features page <features>`.

- Read and organize simulation data (:py:mod:`~.simdir`). Checkpoints and
  restarts are handled transparently.
- Work with scalar data as produced by ``CarpetIOASCII``
  (:py:mod:`~.cactus_scalars`).
- Analyze the multipolar decompositions output by ``Multipoles``
  (:py:mod:`~.cactus_multipoles`).
- Analyze gravitational waves extracted with the Newman-Penrose formalism
  (:py:mod:`~.cactus_waves`) computing, among the other things, strains,
  overlaps, energy lost.
- Work with the power spectral densities of known detectors
  (:py:mod:`~.sensitivity_curves`).
- Represent and manipulate time series (:py:mod:`~.timeseries`). Examples of
  functions available for time series: ``integrate``, ``differentiate``, ``resample``,
  ``to_FrequencySeries`` (Fourier transform).
- Represent and manipulate frequency series (:py:mod:`~.frequencyseries`), like
  Fourier transforms of time series. Inverse Fourier transform is available.
- Manipulate and analyze gravitational-waves (:py:mod:`~.gw_utils`,
  :py:mod:`~.gw_mismatch`). For example, compute energies, mismatches, or
  extrapolate waves to infinity.
- Represent objects as mathematical vectors, matrices, and tensors
  (:py:mod:`~.tensor`).
- Work with 1D, 2D, and 3D grid functions (:py:mod:`~.grid_data`,
  :py:mod:`~.cactus_grid_functions`) as output by ``CarpetIOHDF5`` or
  ``CarpetIOASCII``.
- Work with horizon data from (:py:mod:`~.cactus_horizons`) as output by
  ``QuasiLocalMeasures`` and ``AHFinderDirect``.
- Perform common operations with horizons (:py:mod:`~.hor_utils`).
- Work with timers produced by ``Carpet``
  (:py:mod:`~.cactus_timers`).
- Handle unit conversion, in particular from geometrized to physical
  (:py:mod:`~.unitconv`).
- Write command-line scripts (:py:mod:`~.argparse_helper`).
- Visualize data with ``matplotlib`` (:py:mod:`~.visualize_matplotlib`).
- Make movies with  `motionpicture`_.

The YouTube series
`Using kuibit <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIVVtc6RlFxpi3BiF6KTWd3z4TTQ5hY06>`_
contains video tutorials on ``kuibit``. Each video is focused on a single topic.


Examples
---------

Below you will find a list of examples to perform more or less common analysis.
You can immediately start doing science without writing one line of code using
these examples. The scripts provided can be used for plotting, extracting
gravitational waves, or other useful information. To get the most out of these
examples, check out the :doc:`recommendations on how to
use the examples <recommendation_examples>` page.

Note that all these examples contain a significant fraction of boilerplate that
is needed to keep them general and immediately useful. When learning ``kuibit``,
you can ignore all of this.

You can download these examples as archive from the `GitHub release page
<https://github.com/sbozzolo/kuibit/releases/latest/download/examples.tar.gz>`_,
which is automatically updated with each release.

What is a kuibit?
-----------------

A kuibit (also known as *kukuipad* harvest pole) is the tool traditionally used
by the Tohono O'odham people to reach the fruit of the Saguaro cacti during the
harvesting season. In the same way, this package is a tool that you can use to
collect the fruit of your ``Cactus`` simulations.

Credits
-------

``kuibit`` follows the same design and part of the implementation details of
``PostCactus``, code developed by Wolfgang Kastaun. This fork completely
rewrites the original code, adding emphasis on documentation, testing, and
extensibility. The logo contains elements designed by `freepik.com
<https://freepik.com/>`_. We thank ``kuibit`` first users, Stamatis Vretinaris
and Pedro Espino, for providing comments to improve the code and the
documentation.

Disclaimer
------------

``kuibit`` is developed as professional tool that can be used for research to be
published in peer-reviewed journals. As such, ``kuibit`` is tested to ensure
that results are scientifically sound. However, we do not guarantee that the
