plot_phi_lm.py
=============================================

``plot_phi_lm`` plots the real and imaginary parts of a given (l, m) mode of one
of the :math:`\Phi_i` as measured by a given detector. Here :math:`\Phi_i` are
the Newman-Penrose scalars for Maxwell/Proca. They can be computed with the
thorn ``NPScalars_Proca``.
