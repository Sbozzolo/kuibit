    "In general, we are interested in the strain. `GravitationalWavesOneDet` objects have numerous methods to extract the strain. The most simple is the one to obtain the strain associated to a specific mode. This (as all the other methods that involve strains) needs to take a Fourier transform. To avoid aliasing effects, your signal should go smoothly to zero. In case it doesn't, you have to window it. To do this, you have to pass the `window_function` paramter, and all the additional paramters that the window may need. You can pass the window in multiple ways, but the simplest is to use one the window functions already coded up. In this example, we will use the Tukey window. If you don't need a window, you can pass `None` (or nothing).\n",
    "In addition to the window, you have to provide `pcut`. This is the period that will go in the fixed-frequency integration (`omega_threshold = 2 * pi / pcut`). Choose pcut as the longest physical period you expect in your signal.\n",
