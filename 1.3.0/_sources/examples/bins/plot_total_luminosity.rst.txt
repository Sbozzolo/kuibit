plot_total_luminosity.py
=============================================

``plot_total_luminosity`` plots the total luminosity of gravitational and
electromagnetic waves as a function of time as measured on a given spherical
surface. The luminosity is computed with the Weyl formalism (from :math:`\Psi_4`
and :math:`\Phi_2`).
