plot_charge_phi1.py
=============================================

``plot_charge_phi1`` plots the total electromagnetic charge using the
Newman-Penrose scalars ``Phi1``. It employs the fact that the real part of
``Phi1`` is the radial component of the electric field and that the ``l=0`` and
``m=0`` extract the monopole component.
