plot_constraints.py
=============================================

``plot_constraints`` plots given reductions (e.g., norm2, maximum) of the
constraints (Hamiltonian, momentum) as a function of time. At the moment, it
supports Lean and McLachlan, but it is trivial to extend for other spacetime
solvers.
