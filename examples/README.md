# Examples of working programs built with `kuibit`

In this directory, we collect working programs built with `kuibit`. You can use
these scripts as good examples of ``kuibit`` usage. These codes are ready to be
used, check out our
[recommendations](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit/recommendation_examples.rst)
to get the most of out these examples.

> :warning: While `kuibit` is tested at each commit to ensure that nothing
>           breaks, these codes are not. If you find one that does not work,
>           please report it and we will fix that.

## Scripts available

You can achieve a lot using these scripts. We recommend downloading them and
placing them in you `$PATH` so that they can be used for your simulations.

## Movie files

`kuibit` plays nicely with
[motionpicture](https://github.com/Sbozzolo/kuibit/blob/master/examples/mopi_movies/grid_var),
a Python program to make animations. The following examples can be immediately
be used, for example, to make a movie of the logarithm of `rho_b` on the XY
plane:

``` sh
mopi -m grid_var --resolution 500 --plane xy --variable rho_b --colorbar --interpolation-method bicubic --logscale --vmin -7 --vmax -1 --parallel --outdir movie -x0 -30 -30 -x1 30 30
```

`motionpicture` requires `ffmpeg` to produce the final video. If it is not
available, `motionpicture` will only produce the frames. See

We recommend defining a `MOPI_MOVIES_DIR` environment variable and putting all
the files there. See
[motionpicture](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit/motionpicture.html) for a
quick-start guide.
