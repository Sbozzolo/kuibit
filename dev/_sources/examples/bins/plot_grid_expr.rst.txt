plot_grid_expr.py
=============================================

``plot_grid_expr`` plots any mathematical expression involving 2D grid function
as output by Carpet. It takes as input the expriable, and the region of space
where to plot it. The symbols that can be used are ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``,
``%``, ``^``, ``PI``, ``E``, ``sin(x)``, ``cos(x)``, ``tan(x)``, ``asin(x)``,
``acos(x)``, ``atan(x)``, ``log(x)``, ``log10(x)``, ``abs(x)``, and ``exp(x)``.
For example

.. code-block:: bash

   plot_grid_expr.py "2 * P / rho_b^(3/2) "


This is defined by giving the resolution, the lowermost leftmost coordinate
(``--x0``), and the topmost rightmost one (``--x1``). Optionally, it is possible
to take the logarithm base 10 and/or the absolute value. It is also possible to
perform interpolation in two different ways: one at the level of the data
(slower, but more accurate), and the other at the level of the image using the
interpolations available in matplotlib.
