"""The :py:mod:`~.frequencyseries` module provides a representation of
frequency series.

:py:class:`~.FrequencySeries` can be evenly or unevenly sampled, real or
complex. They support all the mathematical operations and operators you may
expect, and have additional methods, which include ones for taking derivatives,
integrals, apply windows, smooth the signal, take inverse Fourier transform, and
more. Most of these methods are available in two flavors: those that return a
new :py:class:`~.FrequencySeries`, and those which modify the object in place. The
latter have names with imperative verbs.

As in :py:class:`~.TimeSeries`, :py:class:`~.FrequencySeries` are derived from
the :py:class:`~.BaseSeries`, which in turn is derived from the abstract class
:py:class:`~.BaseNumerical`. Some of the capabilities of
:py:class:`~.FrequencySeries` (e.g., overloading the mathematical operators) are
implemented in the parent classes.

Additionally, two functions are defined in this module
:py:func:`~.load_FrequencySeries` and :py:func:`~.load_noise_curve`. Both loads
:py:class:`~.FrequencySeries` from a text file, but :py:func:`~.load_noise_curve`
is a simpler interface for real-valued signals.

        than the one available, it is effectively set to the one available.

        Since Fourier typically transforms explode at fmin = 0, the result of
        the integration is highly sensitive to regions near that frequency.

        If ``same_domain`` is True, it is assumed that all the
        :py:class:`~.FrequencySeries` involved are defined over the same
        frequencies. Turning this on speeds up computations, but it will result
        in incorrect results if the assumption is violated. If it is False, the
        domain of definition of the series is checked, if it is not the same for
        all the series, then they will be resampled.

        :param noise: If None, no weight is applied. If it is a list,

                            are defined over the same frequencies. If you can
                            guarantee this, the computation will be faster.
