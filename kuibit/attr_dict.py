"""The :py:mod:`~.attr_dict` module provides supporting infrastructure to
access dictionary as attributes. That is, to be able to do something like
object.attribute instead of object['attribute'] with attribute dynamically
determined.

This module is widely used in `kuibit`, for example in the ``fields``
attributes. The class :py:class:`~.AttributeDictionary` is used in conjuction
with :py:class:`~.TransformDictionary`, which we use to invoke ``_getitem__``
of the parent class.

class TransformDictionary:
    """TransformDictionary is a wrapper around a dictionary that apply
    transform to the values of the dictionary with the supplied function
    transform. This can be used to sanitize data.

    When initializated, TransformDictionary first scans the input dictionary
    elem to find if there are values that are dictionary themselves. In this
    case, it calls itself recursively. Objects that are not dictionaries
    are left untouched. Everything is then stored in the attribute _elem.

    Let's see an example:
    ``elem = {'first': 'value', 'second': {'nested': 'dictionary'} }``

    _elem will be a dictionary ``{'first': 'value', 'second': td}``, where td
    is :py:class:``~.TransformDictionary`` with
    ``td._elem = {'nested': 'dictionary'}``.

    In the most simple case, a dictionary is mapped into a new dictionary-like
    object with the same keys and values.

    The way we are going to use this is different. Consider a class Vars that
    contains a set of variables. To access this variables you can call
    Vars['varname']. If we initialize :py:class:``~.TransformDictionary`` with
    a dictionary of the form ``{varname: varname}`` and
    ``transform = Vars.__getitem__`` what happens is that calling the
    internal dictionary ``self._elem`` will just be  ``{varname: varname}``,
    but every time we call it, we first have to apply the transform function,
    so what we end up calling is ``Vars.__getitem__(varname)``.
