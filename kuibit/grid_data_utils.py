"""The :py:mod:`~.grid_data_utils` module provides supporting functions to
use the classes in :py:mod:`~.grid_data`.

The functions available are:
- :py:func:`~.common_bounding_box`: takes a list of :py:class:`~.UniformGrid`
  and returns the smallest bounding box that contains all the grids (returning
  the origin and the corner of the box).
- :py:func:`~.merge_uniform_grids`: takes a list of :py:class:`~.UniformGrid`
  with the same grid spacing and returns a new grid that covers all of them.
- :py:func:`~.load_UniformGridData`: read a :py:class:`~.UniformGridData` from
  a file.
- :py:func:`~.sample_function_from_uniformgrid` samples a given function to
  a given :py:class:`~.UniformGrid`.
- :py:func:`~.sample_function` samples a given function to a given
  :py:class:`~.UniformGrid`, specifying the details of the grid in the function
  call.
