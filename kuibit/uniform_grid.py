"""The :py:mod:`~.uniform_grid` module provides representations of uniform

import numpy as np


class UniformGrid:
    """Describes the geometry of a regular rectangular dataset, as well as
    information needed to identify the grid if part of refined grid hierarchy
    (namely component number and refinement level). In practice, this a fixed
    refinement level, or part of it (as output by an MPI process).

    This is a standard Cartesian grid that we will describe with the language
    of computer graphics. To make things clear, let's consider a 2D grid (see
    schematics below). We call the lower left corner "origin" or "x0". We call
    the top right corner "x1". The grid is cell-centered (see Fig 2).

    ..code-block::

        Fig 1

         o---------x1

         |          |

          --------

    The concept of ``shape`` is the same as NumPy shape: it's the number of points
    in each dimension. ``dx`` is the spacing (dx, dy, dz, ...). To fully
    describe a grid, one needs the ``origin``, the ``shape``, and ``x1`` or ``dx``.

    (This is the same convention that Carpet has.)

    This class is supposed to be immutable.
