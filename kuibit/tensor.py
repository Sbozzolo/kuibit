"""The :py:mod:`~.tensor` module provides abstractions to work with tensorial
containers and similar.

The main object defined here is :py:class:`~.Tensor`, which is a that acts as
container for any object :py:class:`~.BaseNumerical`, as in
:py:class:`~.TimeSeries`, or :py:class:`~.UniformGridData`. :py:class:`~.Tensor`
behaves as one would expect them to behave: they are high-level interfaces that
support all the mathematical operations. :py:class:`~.Tensor` also inherit the
attributes from their contained object. For example, if the :py:class:`~.Tensor`
contains :py:class:`~.TimeSeries`, the tensor will dynamically acquire all the
methods in such class.

In pratice, the main way to use :py:class:`~.Tensor` objects is through its
derived classes :py:class:`~.Vector` and :py:class:`~.Matrix`, which implement
all those features one might expect from vector calculus.

Consider the following usage example:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   from kuibit.timeseries import TimeSeries
   from kuibit.tensor import Vector

   # Fake some data that describe the x, y position of two black holes
   times = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)

   bh1_x = np.sin(times)
   bh1_y = np.cos(times)

   # Not really realistic, but it is fake data
   bh2_x = np.sin(2 * times)
   bh2_y = np.cos(2 * times)

   bh1_centroid = Vector([TimeSeries(times, bh1_x), TimeSeries(times, bh1_y)])
   bh2_centroid = Vector([TimeSeries(times, bh2_x), TimeSeries(times, bh2_y)])

   # If we want to compute vx, vy
   bh1_velocity = bh_centroid.differentiated()  # This is a Vector

   # For the distance with another
   distance = bh1_centroid - bh2_centroid  # This is a Vector

   # The magnitude of the distance
   distance = distance.norm()   # This is a TimeSeries

    At the moment, it is only used as a base class for :py:class:`~.Vector` and
    :py:class:`~.Matrix`. So, the class is currently not intended for direct use
    (as it does not have a lot of features). This class is not fully flashed out
    for the general case. It is here mostly as a stub for the two subclasses
    that are below. Implementing a generic tensor class is not trivial and it
    left as an exercise to the reader.

    This class implements the basic infrastrucutre used by :py:class:`~.Vector`
    and :py:class:`~.Matrix`. In particular, it fullfills the requirements set
    by :py:class:`~.BaseNumerical` and it implements a method to broadcast
    attributes from the contained objects to the container itself.

    times a tensor is going to be a tensor with the same shape and elements
    multiplied. Reductions return NumPy arrays.
