"""The :py:mod:`~.cactus_scalars` module provides simple interfaces to access
time series data as output by CarpetASCII, including all the reductions.

There are multiple classes defined in this module:

- :py:class`~.ScalarsDir` interfaces with :py:class:`~.SimDir` and organizes the
  data according to their reduction. This is a dictionary-like object with keys
  the possible reduction (e.g., ``max``, ``average``, ``norm2``). -
- :py:class`~.AllScalars` takes all the files that correspond to a given reduction
  and organize them according to the variables they contain.
- :py:class`~.OneScalar` represents one single scalar variable, with data that
  is represented as :py:class:`~.TimeSeries` objects. :py:class`~.AllScalars` contains
  many :py:class`~.OneScalar` objects.

These are hierarchical classes, one containing the others, so one typically ends
up with a series of brackets or dots to access the actual data. For example, if
``sim`` is a :py:class:`~.SimDir`, ``sim.ts.max['rho_b']`` is maximum of
``rho_b`` represented as :py:class:`~.TimeSeries`.
