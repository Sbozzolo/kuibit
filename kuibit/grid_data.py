"""The :py:mod:`~.grid_data` module provides representations of data on uniform
grids as well as for data on refined grid hierarchies. Standard arithmetic
operations are supported for those data grids, further methods to interpolate
and resample. The number of dimensions is arbitrary.

The important classes defined here are
- :py:class:`~.UniformGridData` represents data on a uniform grid.
- :py:class:`~.HierarchicalGridData` represents data on a refined grid
hierarchy (AMR).

A :py:class:`~.UniformGridData` object contains a :py:class:`~.UniformGrid` one.
Similarly, a :py:class:`~.HierarchicalGridData` contains multiple
:py:class:`~.UniformGridData`.

We also define :py:class:`~.GridSeries`. This is intended to be used for 1D grid
data and it is a way to use the infrastructure for ``Series`` for grid data. The
reason this is useful is that ``Series`` are much simpler and leaner to work
with.

        Undo a reflection about the given dimension.

        The parameter ``parity`` determines how to fill the data.

        This method works only if the data crosses the value 0 along the given
        dimension.

        We assume that the reflection will always be from the positive side to
        the negative. Pre-existing data in the negative side will be overwritten.

        Under certain conditions (which are always met in simulations with
        Carpet), undoing a rotation180 symmetry is the same as undoing a
        reflection symmetry combined with reversing the new data along the other
        dimension involved in the rotation.

        Consider the pictorial representation of a grid:

                 y
                 |
                 |    O
                 |

                 |
                 |
                 |

        First, we perform a reflection along x, and we get

                 y
                 |
            O    |    O
                 |
        ------------------- x
                 |
                 |
                 |

        Next, we reverse the newly copied data

                 y
                 |
                 |    O

            O    |
                 |


        This is a rotation!

        Note that this makes sense only if the grid is symmetric along the other
        axes. So, what we have to do is reverse the array for the other axis in
        the plane of rotation.

        This is why there's a second parameter ``second_reflect_axis``. This is
        a second reflection that occurs only in the part of data that has been
