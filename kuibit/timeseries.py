"""The :py:mod:`~.timeseries` module provides a representation of time series
and convenience functions to create :py:class:`~.TimeSeries`.

:py:class:`~.TimeSeries` can be evenly or unevenly sampled are rich in features.
They support all the mathematical operations and operators you may expect, and
have additional methods, which include ones for taking derivatives, integrals,
apply windows, smooth the signal, take Fourier transform, and more. Most of
these methods are available in two flavors: those that return a new
:py:class:`~.TimeSeries`, and those which modify the object in place. The latter
have names with imperative verbs.

:py:class:`~.TimeSeries` are derived from the :py:class:`~.BaseSeries`, which in
turn is derived from the abstract class :py:class:`~.BaseNumerical`. Some of the
capabilities of :py:class:`~.TimeSeries` (e.g., overloading the mathematical
operators) are implemented in the parent classes.

The additional functions provided in :py:mod:`~.timeseries` are:

- :py:func:`~.remove_duplicated_iters` cleans the input arrays by removing duplicated times.
- :py:func:`~.unfold_phase` takes as argument a NumPy array representing a phase
  and unfolds it removing all the jumps of 2 pi. This is useful in gravitational
  wave analysis.
- :py:func:`~.combine_ts` takes a list of timeseries and removes all the overlapping segments.
