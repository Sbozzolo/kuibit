"""The :py:mod:`~.cactus_grid` module provides functions to load grid function
in Cactus formats.

There are multiple classes defined in this module:

- :py:class`~.GridFunctionsDir` interfaces with :py:class:`~.SimDir` and
  organizes the grid functions by dimensionality. This is a dictionary-like
  object with keys the possible dimensions (e.g., ``x``, ``yz``, ``xyz``).
- :py:class`~.AllGridFunctions` takes all the files in SimDir and sort them
  according the different grid functions they contain.
- There are two :py:class`~.OneGridFunction` classes, one for HDF5 files and one
  for ASCII files. They describe one single grid function and they contains the
  files associated to that grid function. Both the classes are derived from the
  same abstract base class :py:class`~.OneGridFunctionBase`, which implements
  the shared methods.

These are hierarchical classes, one containing the others, so one typically ends
up with a series of brackets to access the actual data. For example, if ``sim``
is a :py:class:`~.SimDir`, ``sim.gf.xy['rho_b'][0]`` is ``rho_b`` at iteration 0
on the equatorial plane represented as :py:class:`~.HierarchicalGridData`.
