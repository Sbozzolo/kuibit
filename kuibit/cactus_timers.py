"""The :py:mod:`~.cactus_timers` module provides an interface to Cactus timers.

Currently, the only timers supported are from the XML output by Carpet with the
option ``output_xml_timer_tree = yes``.

The main class defined in this module is :py:class:`~.TimersDir`. This is a
dictionary-like object that contains most of the information available in the
timers. The keys of this class are the various MPI ranks (ie, process numbers)
found in the output. The value are :py:class:`~.Tree` objects. These trees
contain the reported call-stack of the simulation with the associated timing
information. Simulation restarts are summed up. Often, it is useful to know how
much a function took on average across different MPI ranks. This can be accessed
with the :py:meth:`TimerDir.average` method.

Example of usage:

.. code-block:: python

   # Assuming sim is a SimDir
   avg_timers = sim.timers.average

   # avg_timers.name contains the name of the top level function, main
   # avg_timers.value contains the time took on average by such function

   # avg_timers.children contains a tuple with all the functions called by main.
   # The type of these functions is Tree, so they have a name and value attribute.

   # By default, the units are second. If you want to normalize to 1 and get the
   # percentual value, you can use
   normalized_avg_timers = avg_timers / avg_timers.tot_value_leaves

   print(normalized_avg_timers.value)   # Should be 1

   # Another useful feature is to represent the timer tree with a dictionary or a
   # json file, for postprocessing
   print(normalized_avg_timers.to_json())
