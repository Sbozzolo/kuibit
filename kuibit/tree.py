"""The :py:mod:`~.tree` module provides a data structure to work with trees.

The :py:class:`~.Tree` describes one node of a tree with a name and a value. The
node has any number of children, which are objects of the type
:py:class:`~.Tree` themselves. (There is no real distinction on what is a node
and what is a tree.) Given a :py:class:`~.Tree`, the children can be accessed by
index or by name. :py:class:`~.Tree` can also be exported to dictionaries or
JSON strings.

Different trees can be combined with the function :py:func:`~.merge_trees`,
which acts in the followin way. It takes any number of nodes that share the name
and create a new tree with that name. The children of this new tree are obtained
by combining all the children of the given nodes, and when children have the
same name, the new value is obtained by applying a given function (e.g., summing
up).

Currently, the main use of this structure in ``kuibit`` is for timers.
