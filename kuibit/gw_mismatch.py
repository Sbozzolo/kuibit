"""The :py:mod:`~.gw_mismatch` module functions to compute the mismatch between
two waves using a simple grid search for phase and time shifts. Since no
polarization shifts are performed, this is only relevant to the gravitational
wave 2,2 mode.

The two main interfaces are :py:func:`~.network_mismatch_from_psi4` (when
computing the network mismatch starting from psi4 and the sky localization) and
:py:func:`~.mismatch_from_strains` (when computing the mismatch from the
strains).

    r"""Compute the network-mismatch between ``h1`` and ``h2`` by maximizing the
    overlap over time and polarization shifts.

    Network here means that the inner product is computed for N detectors, as
    provided by the lists antenna_patterns and noises. Noises and antenna
    patterns have to be properly ordered: ``noises[i]`` has to correspond to
    ``antenna_pattern[i]``.

    See :ref:`gw_mismatch:Overlap and mismatch` for formulas and details.

    The mismatch is computed by maximizing over time and polarization shifts.
    Polarization shifts and are around the 2pi, time shifts are specified by
    time_shift_start and time_shift_end. If num_time_shifts is 1, then no time
    shift is performed. For times, we make sure that we always have to zero
    timeshift. All the transformations are done in h2.

    This computation is a maximisation, which is very expensive. So, we have a
    very fast core function called _mismatch_core_numerical to do all the hard
    work. This function is compiled to native code by numba, resulting to
    enormous speed-up.There is an overhead in calling numba. Hence, by default
    we do not always use numba. We use it only when the number
    num_polarization_shifts * num_time_shifts is greater than 500*500. You can
    force using numba passing the keyword argument force_numba=True.

    We do not perform phase shifts here, so this function makes sense only
    for the (2,2) mode.

    h1 and h2 have to be already pre-processed for Fourier transform, so you
    should window them and zero pad as needed.

    # In kuibit, we have beautiful collection of classes to represent

    # 1. large number of function calls (expensive in Python)
    # 2. several redundant operations
    # 3. several checks that we can guarantee will be passed
    # ...
    # Computing the mismatch is a numerical operation, we should be able
    # to crunch numbers at the speed of light (ie, as fast as C). For this,
