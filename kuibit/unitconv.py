r"""This module provides a class Units representing unit systems or unit
conversions.

Units can be used to convert from geometrized units to SI.

For example, assuming a that we are using geometrized units with :math:`G = c =
M = 1`, where :math:`M = 65 M_\odot`, we can defined the object ``CU =
geom_umass(65 * M_SUN_SI)``. CU knows how to convert geometrized quantities to
SI: for instance, to convert the length variable d from geometrized units to SI,
just multiply d times ``CU.length``. Similarly for all the other quantities.

The module provides convenience functions to define geometrized system of units:
:py:func:`~.geom_umass_msun`, :py:func:`~.geom_umass`, and
:py:func:`~.geom_length` can be used to generate :py:class:`~.Units` objects
that know how to convert from/to SI and geometrized units where lengthscale or
mass scales were defined.

The following natural constants are defined (in SI units)

- ``C_SI``          (Vacuum speed of light)
- ``G_SI``          (Gravitational constant)
- ``M_SOL_SI``      (Solar mass)
- ``M_SUN_SI``      (Solar mass)
- ``LIGHTYEAR_SI``  (Lightyear)
- ``MEGAPARSEC_SI`` (Megaparsec)
- ``PARSEC_SI``     (Parsec)
- ``H0_SI``         (Hubble constant [1/s])

class Units:
    """Class representing unit conversion. The unit system is specified by
    length, time, and mass units, from which derived units are computed.

    This class can be used to convert units from one system to another.

    For example, define ``CGS = Units(1.0e-2, 1.0, 1.0e-3)``.
    If the length d is in SI, then ``d * CGS.length`` will be in CGS.

    The main use of Units in kuibit is to provide a way to convert from
