plot_binary_ah_angular_velocity.py
=============================================

``plot_binary_ah_period`` plots the the Newtonian angular velocity of the
associated Kepler problem with the cross product between the separation and its
time derivative. By default, the script only shows the ``z`` component, but all
the components can be plotted with ``--all_components``.
