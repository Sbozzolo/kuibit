    "I wish I had kuibit when I started working with the Einstein Toolkit."

    -- Gabriele Bozzola, PhD candidate at The University of Arizona (2021)

    "As a PhD with no previous experience in numerical relativity, kuibit enabled
    me to analyze simulations, instead of spending months to understand and
    write programs only to read the simulation data.

    It allowed me to focus on the science."

    -- Stamatis Vretinaris, PhD student at Radbout University (2021)

    "By making the process of parsing, processing, and visualizing my
    Cactus-produced data far simpler than any other tool, Kuibit has made me
    realize how much my old methods for doing these things were holding me back.

    I find myself asking more and better scientific questions now that exploring
    my data and making diverse visualizations is not the time sink it used to
    be."

    -- Erik Wessel, PhD candidate at The University of Arizona (2021)

    "With Kuibit, I could use my favorite way (in Jupyter notebook) of working
    with simulation data which no other tool currently provides. Moreover, it
    follows best practices in making the details of data easily available to
    work with. I would recommend it to any beginner into Cactus data analysis."

    -- Rahul Kashyap, Postdoctoral Scholar in the Eberly College of Science, Pennsylvania State University (2021)
